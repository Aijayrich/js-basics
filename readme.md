   6) Dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at runtime, while statically typed languages perform type checking at compile time. This means that scripts written in dynamically-typed languages can compile even if they contain errors that will prevent the script from running properly (if at all). If a script written in a statically-typed language  contains errors, it will fail to compile until the errors have been fixed.

   Also, statically-typed languages require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them, while dynamically-typed languages do not. 

   Examples of both types:
Examples of dynamically typed languges include: JavaScript, Objective-C, PHP, Python, Ruby, Lisp, and Tcl.
Examples of statically-typed languages include Java, C, C++, FORTRAN, Pascal and Scal

7) The key difference between null and undefined in JavaScript is that null is used to assign a non-value to a variable while undefined is used when a variable is declared but not assigned with a value.
